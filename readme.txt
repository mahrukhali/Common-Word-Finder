What data structure do you expect to have the best (fastest) performance? 
Which one do you expect to be the slowest? Do the results of timing your program execution
match your expectations? If so, briefly explain the correlation. If not, what run times 
deviated and briefly explain why you think this is the case. 

The data structure I expect to have the best performance is hash maps.
The one I expect to be the slowest is bst. The results of timing in my 
programs execution match my expectations. The hash map took 2.427 seconds.
The AVL map took 7.621 seconds and the bst map took 7.633 seconds. 
Inserting an item in Hash maps are faster since you just hash the key and insert it.
As well as accessing it, while for trees inserting and accessing take a longer runtime. 
Therefore hash maps gave a better performance as it executed in less time.
